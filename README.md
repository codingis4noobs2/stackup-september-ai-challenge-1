**Challenge: Create a StackUp Helpdesk Chatbot Using Any LLM API**

Your task is to develop a Discord bot that serves as a helpdesk for StackUp, using any LLM APIs available (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-3.5, Claude, etc.). The bot should assist users with their queries, utilizing the knowledge base from the StackUp Help Centre: [StackUp Help Centre](https://stackuphelpcentre.zendesk.com/hc/en-us). **You are free to use any technology stack you prefer; there are no restrictions on the tools or platforms you can use.**

**Requirements:**
- The bot must include a `!ask` command to handle user queries. Adding slash commands is a plus if possible.
- Be creative, Think about what additional features the bot can offer to enhance the user experience.

**Judging Criteria:**
- **Functionality:** How well the bot responds to queries using `!ask`.
- **Creativity:** Innovative features or functionalities beyond basic query handling.
- **Code Quality:** Clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
