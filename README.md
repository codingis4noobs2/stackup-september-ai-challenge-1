**Challenge: Create a Chatbot Using Any LLM API**

Your task is to develop a chatbot using any LLM APIs available (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-3.5, Claude, etc.).  
- You have to develop a chatbot for a specific use case, such as:
  - **Recipe Bot:** Ask for ingredients or preferences, and the AI generates a recipe.
  - **AI Fitness Coach:** Provide your dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, non-veg, vegan), height, weight, workout capability, and expected body shape, and the AI creates a fitness routine.
- Try to come up with your own unique use case, extra marks will be awarded for originality.

**Requirements:**
- Your project must include an interface where judges can interact with your chatbot. 
- While we recommend using Streamlit or Gradio for quick development as there are no extra points for good UI/UX, youâ€™re free to use any technology you prefer.
